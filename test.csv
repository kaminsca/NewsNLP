andalusiastarnews--2020-04-04--Remember When: Shehan’s Polio story,Remember When: Shehan’s Polio story,"Dan Shehan’s “My Polio Story” is continued in this week’s column. The dread disease of the 1950s, polio, was a pandemic similar to today’s Coronavirus, but there were no quarantines of families or shut-downs of businesses and vaccines were soon developed. There were warnings which families heeded in order to try and keep their children free of poliomyelitis.

Dr. Morgan Moore remembers that Dr. Kenneth Moore Hannon was the orthopedic doctor who came regularly to Andalusia from Mobile to work in the Crippled Children’s Clinic held in the downstairs of the Scherf Memorial Building on Opp Avenue. Appointments were made at the Red Cross. The medical doctors in the Andalusia area often referred their patients to Dr. Hannon at the charity clinic before there was Medicaid and later to Dr. Lawrence Bowness, the orthopedic doctor who moved to town from Chicago. He had been the Chicago Bears orthopedic physician.

Shehan as a ten year old child had been struck one morning upon waking with a stiff neck and terrific headache that progressed to weakness, an inability to breathe, and paralysis.

He was taken by his parents in the back of their car to Pensacola and shortly thereafter placed in an iron lung which aided him in breathing and feeling better. His parents had contacted his uncle, Dr. Robert Earl Vickery, a student in medical school at Birmingham and his professor who flew in a plane to Pensacola in the middle of the night to assist and consult.

Dan later placed on a Navy plane and flown to Birmingham, was accompanied by his two maternal uncles, Norman and Henry Everage, who took turns pumping the iron lung during the flight since the plane did not have electrical power.

The doctors told his parents that he would never be able to walk again and would be in a wheelchair the rest of his life! He was eventually transferred from Jefferson Hillman Hospital to Crippled Children’s Hospital next door where he stayed for the next six months. He gradually gained the use of his arms and legs and celebrated his 11th birthday while he was being given physical therapy and whirlpool baths. It was during therapy that a therapist noticed a slight curve in his spine, the onset of scoliosis, which began his life-long struggle to overcome that further curving.

In the spring of 1954, his parents moved to the community of Gonzalez, Florida near Pensacola where his father, a master carpenter, had built the family a new house with wide doors to accommodate a wheelchair. By this time, Dan had proved the doctors wrong and was walking on his own. He attended junior high at Tate High School.

In 1957, it was decided that the family needed to move to Warm Springs, Georgia, the center established by President Roosevelt, and that Dan would be admitted to the Warm Springs Clinic for treatment of scoliosis and for fitting of a brace which consisted of a corset with a steel bar on the back and a mechanism to hold up his chin and head. He wore this brace until he finished high school in 1960 at the Brent Christian High School in Pensacola.

After Shehan’s freshman year at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, he underwent a final fusion with Harrington rods after which he resumed college and was graduated with a B. S. degree in secondary education in January 1966. He found a teaching position for the 2nd semester in DeFuniak Springs, Florida. By the beginning of the next school year, he was hired by Andalusia High School Principal Murray King as an English teacher.

After his first year of teaching, he chaperoned eight high school students on a six-week tour of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France. During the next three summers, he attended the University of South Alabama and was graduated with a Master of Arts degree in English education.

This is what determination did for one person who suffered with polio as a child, but his bout was not over yet.

Around the year 1976, Mr. Shehan began to feel quite fatigued by the end of each day. Then one night, he realized that he was having difficulty breathing when he reclined in the bed to sleep. He ended up in the emergency room and then admitted to the hospital to be given oxygen. By the next day, he was barely conscious. He was given a tracheotomy and placed on a breathing machine for about a week until his condition improved. When released from the hospital, he found it necessary to sleep elevated in a recliner.

After consulting with a doctor in Houston, Texas, it was prescribed for him to return sleeping in an iron lung. His mother called around and finally found help at Emory University in Atlanta which maintained a March of Dimes equipment center in Augusta, Georgia.

The March of Dimes shipped an iron lung to his home in Andalusia which “stabilized my life,” Shehan stated. Someone (his mother) would have to latch and unlatch it. One day for a nap, he was latched in by his mother. She went to visit a friend and forgot to come back on time. When he awoke and discovered that she had not returned, he had to extricate himself by tearing the flexible collar around his neck in order to unlatch the lung. Upon relating his story to the March of Dimes equipment center, he was informed that the iron lung could be modified with latches operating from the inside. He was shipped the modified lung in exchange for the one he had. This new iron lung gave him the needed independence.

By 1995 when Mr. Shehan retired from the field of education, one of the doctors tried him on a bi-pap machine. It took a little time of getting used to wearing a mask, but he was finally free of the iron lung.

For many years, Mr. S. Daniel Shehan collaborated to write music with English teacher friend Joseph C. Wingard, lyricist and poet. Together they hosted annual Christmas Sing-a-Long events for 25 years and published a booklet of their original Christmas songs. Shehan served as an organist for many years at the First Baptist Church and also after his move at the Bull Street Baptist Church in Savannah. When asked who taught him to play the organ, he stated that his father built him a little playhouse in the back yard. He bought him a portable fold-up organ and made foot pedals with strings wired to the keyboard. His mother taught him “Old Rugged Cross” and then he just kind of figured things out for himself from there on – another amazing accomplishment of one who almost died several times from the complications of polio.

While residing in Andalusia after his teaching career, Dan Shehan, historical society member, became an historic preservationist purchasing and restoring the First National Bank Building on Court Square as well as some other downtown buildings and apartments. He once resided in the upper floor of the FNBB as landlord of fully occupied apartments where he emphasizes, “The view from above was outstanding!”

This polio survivor of great magnitudes is retired at last and living in Savannah, Georgia where he is an active member of the Coastal Empire Polio Survivors Association. He desires to donate his iron lung to the Three Notch Museum where this artifact might be housed to interpret the polio pandemic of the 1950s for the enlightenment of future generations. If anyone who might be traveling across the state of Georgia in the near future can arrange to transport this back to Andalusia, Alabama, please contact this writer.

Yes, we need to Remember When that unfortunately, these pandemics come and go. They are part of our history to learn from. Many recent stories are being preserved, I understand, by the University of New Orleans in partnership with Arizona State University. The goal is to create an historical record of the pandemic as it unfolds so that future generations will remember what people experienced in this unprecedented time from the mundane to the extraordinary.

There have been many responses from this area on social media and surely more will follow. Maybe with the arrival of spring and summer, the world can look forward to the return of our normal lives, happier and healthier times ahead! As Dickens’ Tiny Tim once observed, “God bless us everyone!” Thanks to S. Daniel Shehan for allowing his poignant story to be told.

andalusiastarnews--2020-04-04--Governor issues stay at home order,Governor issues stay at home order,"Governor Kay Ivey announced that a stay at home order has been issued for the entire state effective Saturday afternoon at 5 p.m.

Ivey said that some may question why she chose to do this now.

I wanted Alabamians to be prepared for what at the time was a little known virus that was impacting the rest of the world.

I wanted the facts and the data and sound science to dictate the decisions,” she said.

She said she did not want to overreact, but wanted to protect public health without choking the life out of business and commerce.

Ivey said that Alabama is seeing an increasing number of positives in COVID-19 cases, with more than 160 new positives yesterday.

Ivey said that so far 34 people have died including someone as young as 33 years old.

She said the state is expecting a surge in hospitalization in the next two to there week.

“Those are the ones who will become infected in the next few days,” she said. “Over 200 health care workers are already infected. We now have outbreaks in multiple nursing home that led to multiple deaths.”

Metrics from cellphone data shows that people are not adhering to the previous orders.

“Bottom line is folks are not paying attention,” she said.

“Our previous efforts to limit social interaction have not been enough,” the governor said. “This is why we are taking this more drastic steps. April stands to be very tough and very deadly for our state. I can’t say this anymore clearly the COVID-19 is an imminent way of life. It is now the law to stay at home.”

There are a few exceptions, she said.

You can still go out and get your groceries and pharmacies.

Store will be required to institute more stringent rules such as 50 percent of the fire marshal-allowed people in a business.

“My fellow Alabamians I plead with you, I urge you in the strongest way possible take this seriously. Otherwise it is a fact more people will die,” Ivey said.

State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said there is a back log from commercial labs of somewhere of up to eight days; however, he said that ADPH tests are coming through within 72 days.

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said that violating the law is a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500 for each time.

andalusiastarnews--2020-04-03--Students  prepare for  online classes,Students  prepare for  online classes,"Students across Covington County are scheduled to begin online classes on Monday, April 6.

The schools will be using an application called “Google Classroom”—a Google application that is available to anyone with a personal Google account that’s goal is to “streamline the process of sharing files and coursework between teachers and students” according to their website.

“By now you have heard the state has mandated the end of traditional school for the remainder of the year; however, we will complete this school year beginning April 6 via distance learning,” said Ted Watson, superintendent of Andalusia City Schools.

County schools are also following this schedule and will begin online classes on Monday, April 6, to complete the academic school year.

“We do assignments through Google Classrooms and get announcements through Remind (a private mobile messaging app used by schools, teachers, and students),” said J.D. Hudson, a junior at Florala High School (FHS).

Senior students everywhere seem to be at a loss on how to respond to the cancelation of traditional school and the switch to online.

“I’m waiting it out,” said Jenna Goolsby, a senior at FHS. “There’s really nothing else I can do. You know, I’m a senior. Graduation is postponed until I don’t know when.”

“I feel awful for the seniors,” said Emily Mullins, a junior at Straughn High School (SHS). “It’s really upsetting that they are missing out on things like a normal graduation and prom.”

“As long as you [seniors] didn’t have any F’s for the third-nine weeks [report card], then you’re a grad[uate],” said Haley Martin, a senior at FHS. “If you did [have an F] then you have to take classes online.”

“I just have to finish my dual enrollment classes, but everything else is done,” said Lucy Dantz, a senior at SHS. “I’m a senior, so my other classes are just finished.”

Although the scheduled classes have yet to begin, students have begun to express their concerns with continuing the school year online.

“You [students] get to work at your own pace online—which is a positive,” said Hudson. “But at the same time, you’re not seeing everyone else.”

“It’s going to be challenging because we won’t have help if we need it,” said Dianna-Grace Nelson, a freshman at Andalusia High School (AHS). “I’m a good student and think I’ll do alright, but there’s some people that don’t and won’t be able to get help.”

“My worries are that some students may not perform as well as they would at school because some students do better getting taught one-on-one, and not through a video or just from words on a screen,” said Rashaad Coleman, a junior at FHS.

“I can’t really get the help I need at home, so me and my friends are making a group chat to help each other,” said Leilah Coachman, a freshman at AHS.

“It’s sad we went to our last day of school and didn’t even know it,” said Dantz. “It’s kind of hard to deal with. Talking with my friends helps, but we can’t be together and deal with it in person. It’s hard sometimes. It’s happening to everyone and talking with them [friends] helps me not feel as alone.”

“We’ve done testing online before, so I’m not really worried about the testing part,” said Allie Kelley, a junior at SHS.

“If you tried, I think people could finish all of their [class]work in three or four hours,” said Hudson. “But that’s if you’re very motivated.”

“I don’t think it’ll take me that long to finish the work, though,” said Coleman. “But I’d understand if people were worried about tests and all that.”

“We won’t be doing semester exams [at FHS] as far as I know,” said Hudson.

State testing has already been canceled earlier in the month by President Trump, but schools within Covington County have yet to announce anything about year-end exams and the testing process online.

“Please be patient with us as we swim these uncharted waters,” said Watson. “These are uncertain times but I’m very confident that we will find ourselves on the other end of this stronger than ever.”",Covington,Alabama,andalusiastarnews,37729,83.5140077924143,37313.0,85.0785142684584
"andalusiastarnews--2020-04-03--Local banks await final rules, guidance for paycheck protection","Local banks await final rules, guidance for paycheck protection","As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease continues to impact communities across the country, Alabama banks including local Covington County banks such as CCB Community Bank and SIB are making the health and well-being of their employees, customers and the communities they serve their top priority.

Banks of all sizes are taking steps to respond to the needs of individual and business customers, while continuing to execute their own business continuity plans under challenging conditions.

Bank actions to assist customers vary based on a customer’s individual needs and circumstances.

In the passage of the CARES Act, including the needed Paycheck Protection Plan, the United States Congress provided much needed stimulus funding to benefit small businesses desperate for help as a result of the pandemic.

As is the case in most any crisis, there seem to be more questions than answers about the expectations of the federal government in executing the steps necessary to begin issuing funds. While limited guidance has been issued by the Small Business Administration and the U. S. Treasury, banks continue to await final instructions from Washington, D.C. on how the process will work. “Banks across the nation are literally waiting for instructions from the government on how to move forward. While we are grateful for the help, we are frustrated that those needing help the most are forced to suffer while the rules are still being written,” ABA President and CEO Scott Latham said. “Banks across Alabama have a strong reputation of helping individuals and small businesses during good times as well as the challenging times, and this difficult period will be no exception. Until the rules are final, we are simply in a waiting game that is out of our control.” Alabama banks entered this pandemic from a position of strength, thanks to record capital and liquidity levels as well as prudent planning and risk management. Our banks look forward to helping small businesses across Alabama get back to work and seeing our economy resume its strength and our lives return to normalcy. The Alabama Bankers Association represents 126 banks. Banks in Alabama have combined deposits of more than $100 billion and have 1,466 locations across the state.",Covington,Alabama,andalusiastarnews,37729,83.5140077924143,37313.0,85.0785142684584

The new portal has been in development for several months, Utilities Office Manager Cathy Alexander said. The new portal is more secure and provides better tools for managing utilities accounts.

Those who are accustomed to using the previous portal will need to create a new account, but may use the same credentials as in the previous portal.

To create the account, customers will need three things: their utilities account number, the amount of their most recent bill; and the telephone number on file for the account. After entering the information, the customer will receive an email. Once that email is open and the customer clicks through the link provided, the customer account will be activated.

To access the portal, go to the City of Andalusia web site, choose Utilities, then Administrative, then click on “Make a Payment.” Alternately, go directly to https://utilitypayment.cityofandalusia.com/mscp/auth/login.

At present, the Utilities Office, which is located in Andalusia City Hall, is closed to the public in observation of social distancing. Alexander reminds customers that payments can be made by phone, by mail, at the drive-through window, the drop box, or by bank draft.

Seniors in Covington County Schools and Opp City Schools have completed their school year and are now considered graduates.

State School Superintendent Dr. Eric Mackey and the state task force gave superintendents the directive that a high school senior who is considered in good standing and on track to graduate at the end of the third nine weeks was eligible to be declared a graduate.

Covington County Schools Superintendent Shannon Driver and Opp City Schools Superintendent Michael Smithart both followed the state’s advice and their seniors are done with high school.

The decision is up to each individual school system.

Andalusia City Schools Superintendent Ted Watson said ACS had opted not to do that.

Watson explained that Andalusia City Schools curricula requires seniors to earn 29 credits, which is five over the state’s 24.

“What we are looking at here is getting to a normal end of the school year,” he said. “Since we require 29 credits to graduate, we are going to opt to ride out the year.”

Watson said the reasoning is to make sure that all students are able to complete their classes to set them up to be successful when they go on to the next step in life.

Additionally, Andalusia High School students are on block schedules, which means they have only complete half of the courses for the year.",Covington,Alabama,andalusiastarnews,37729,83.5140077924143,37313.0,85.0785142684584
